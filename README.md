# Simon Game

A simple implementation of the Simon Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

The Simon Game is a classic memory game where players have to mimic a sequence of button flashes generated by the computer. The game starts when a key is pressed, and players must follow the increasing sequence of button flashes. If they successfully mimic the entire sequence, the game advances to the next level.
